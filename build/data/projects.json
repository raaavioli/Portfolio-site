       "description": "Flying Flame was the final project that I, together with a friend at KTH, built at the end of our first year of the Computer Science-programme at KTH. </br></br> The game is a 2D 'highscore-based' game where you control a helicopter to avoid and bomb parachuting, walking and stationary slimes, flying birds and homing projectiles. The game was drawn and animated by us ourselves and we put alot of effort into making a solid and interesting gameplay."

      "description": "The Boss of the Black Market is the first larger project/game I ever created. The code is messy, the functions are inefficient and the design is dull. But rather than being a <i>good project</i> I think this project more reflects on me as a creative person making use of the knowledge I have to solve problems and build things I probably should not be able to with my level of experience. </br></br> The game consists of an A*-pathfinding algorithm taking one or multiple ship(s) across the sea on a node-based-worldmap. The purpose is to visit harbors across the world to trade illegal goods and make big money!"
