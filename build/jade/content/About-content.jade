        | My name is <strong>Oliver Eriksson</strong>, and I'm a software developer!
      p
        | All my life I have been interested in the fields of maths and science aswell as spending hours upon hours by the computer.         
      p
        | With a <strong>curiousity to encounter complex problems</strong> together with never being afraid of <strong>asking questions</strong>(<i>literally anyone who has ever been around me could confirm</i>), 
        | I am a person who gets a deep understanding of problems and situations. This makes me a <strong>useful team member</strong>, as the deep understanding enables me to explain and communicate information to
        | people around me in a fairly simple and clear way.
      p
        | Currently I study my third year of university at KTH (<i>Royal Institute of Technology</i>) in Sweden, and 
        | I have been programming since my second year of highschool where I found the art of web-development. 
      p
        | As my interest in programming has grown I've expanded my vocabulary, and today I am pretty confident writing production-level Java and C++. 
        | Lately I have also grown an interest in graphics programming, and with that I am pretty familiar with OpenGL, and I have also lately dug myself into the Vulkan API.

        | So, this webpage was first just another side-project of mine. The goal was to <strong>learn more about web development</strong> as my first year of uni was focused on basic object-oriented programming using Java. 
      
      p
        | Using and learning <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> and <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, I started designing what is now the <a href="/">front-page</a> of this website. What most of you visiting probably didn't know though, is that the front-page is actually a non-image plain css (<i>sass</i>) replica of my own real <a>desktop</a>!  
      p
        | As I progressed and <strong>put in alot of hours</strong> into the project, I later decided to use the css-style image I created as a front-page to what is now <strong>my first personal website</strong>!
        
      p 
        | <strong>The purpose of my website</strong> is to allow fellow programmers, employers or anyone interested to have a look at <strong>who I am</strong>, <strong>what I do</strong> and <strong>how I work</strong> 
        | to encourage taking contact with me for possible collaborations, ideations or employments!
